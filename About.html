      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Healing Tails was created on a simple belief that animals have a healing
        effect on people and vice versa. We believe that animals and people who
        overcome their fears and trauma together build an unbreakable bond and 
        live a much happier life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea originated when we realized that trauma survivors who had 
        adopted rescue animals noticed a massive shift in their wellbeing. We 
        believe that the companionship of a loyal dog, the gentle presence of a 
        cat or the playful nature of a rabbit or bird offers a different level of 
        comfort that traditional therapy fails to achieve.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        We strengthen bonds between rescue animals and humans through mutual healing. 
        We provide programs that pair animals with individuals to create a safe environment 
        for them both and build community projects that spread love, kindness and understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every step we take is guided by the belief that healing is not one sided. 
        When we care for animals, they care for us in return.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Dream</h2>
      <p>
        We dream of a world where every animal has a home and every person has access to a healing tail.
        We want communities to embrace the value of kindness, empathy and connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that when shelters are empty, hearts are full. Every wag, purr, squeak and flutter 
        of wings brings hope. We strive to show that animals and humans can create a healthier, 
        happier and more compassionate world together.
