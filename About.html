        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <p>
            Healing Tails was created on a simple belief that animals have a healing
            effect on people and vise versa. We belive that animals and people who
            overcome their fears and trauma together build an unbreakable bond and 
            live a much happier life. <!--(The IIE, 2025)-->
            <br><br>
            The idea originated when we realized that when trauma survivors, who had 
            adopted a rescue animal, noticed a massive shift in their wellbeing. We 
            believe that the companionship of a loyal dog, the gentle presense of a 
            cat or the playful nature of a rabbit or bird offers a diffirent level of 
            comfort that traditional therapy fails to achieve. After hearing all these stories 
            about trauma survivors, we decided to create Healing Tails to formally introduce 
            rescued animals and individuals in need of emotional, mental and physical support. <!--(The IIE, 2025)-->
            <br><br>
            Over time Healing Tails have grown from a small community initiative into a well 
            structured non-profit organization. Today it serves as a safe space where both 
            humans and animals can find trust, companionship and healing. <!--(The IIE, 2025)-->
            <br><br>
            Each rescue story becomes a part of Healing Tail - of HOPE. <!--(The IIE, 2025)-->
            <br><br>
            We thrive to by giving animals onother chance at life while also giving survivors 
            the gift of unconditional love. <!--(The IIE, 2025)-->

        <h2>Our purpose</h2>
        <p>
            We strengthen bonds between rescue animals and humans through mutual healing. 
            We provide programs that pair animals with individuals to create a safe environment 
            for them both and build community projects that spreads love, kindness and understanding.
            Every step we take is guided by the belief that healing is not one sided. <!--(The IIE, 2025)-->
            <br><br>
            When we care for animals, they care for us in return. <!--(The IIE, 2025)-->
