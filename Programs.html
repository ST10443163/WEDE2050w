            We believe that every bond between animals and humans are unique and 
            so is every healing journey. That is why we offer a variety of programs 
            designed to bring comfort, companionship and growth to people of all 
            ages and backgrounds. <!--(The IIE, 2025)-->

            love while people gain a safe space to heal and grow. <!--(The IIE, 2025)-->
